# jethroTime
A fun and dumb website to get better at coding.
This has been made purely as a means to practice code using a humorous topic. Zero malicious intent here. Just a bit silly.

To-Do list

1. Refinement of 'Jethro fact'
  i. Use array to store and then random number asign a 'fact'.
  ii. Increase number of 'facts'. - DONE - Awaiting next version. 
2. Better adaption of browser for desktop and mobile.
  i. Better use of bootstrap
3. API compatiblity to provide a general or 'fun fact'.
  i. Need to learn API intergration for HTML first. 
4. Amend placeholders and proof-read.
